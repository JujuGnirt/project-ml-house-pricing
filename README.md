# project-ml-house-pricing


**Context**
This project aims to estimate house prices using a supervised machine learning approach. We explored the impact of multiple property featuresâ€”including size, location, and conditionâ€”on housing prices. Our goal was to build an accurate and explainable regression model to predict real estate value.

The project was carried out as part of a short data science sprint by a team of four, combining data analysis, feature engineering, and model experimentation.



**ðŸŽ¯Prediction**

Predict the price of a house based on features like surface area, number of bathrooms, location (zipcode), etc.

The target variable is continuous, making this a regression problem.

# Main dataset issues

Presence of outliers in features like sqft_living and price

Missing values in certain features

Zip codes are categorical but need numerical representation for regression

Correlation between features.

# Solutions for the dataset issues

Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., id, date, etc.)

Encoded zipcode using a ratio-based transformation tied to average house price

Removed outliers based on domain knowledge and percentile filtering

Checked correlation both linearly and non-linearly (e.g., Pearson + heatmaps) 

# Models Tested

Model                   Performance (RÂ² on Test)
K-Nearest Neighbors        0.49
Decision Tree              0.72
Random Forest              0.78

# Insights 

sqft_living, grade, and bathrooms were among the most important features driving price.

A custom transformation on zipcode helped reduce its categorical noise and made it more informative.

# Futur Works and Improvement

Spend more time on cross-validation
Using Relative Error instead of Absolute so our range of error correspond to the price we predict
Include time-related variables (year sold, seasonality)
Incorporate external data (schools, crime rates, transport)
